GitHub Webhook Event Tracker
This project is a Flask-based application that listens to GitHub webhook events—specifically push, pull request, and merge events from a repo called action-repo. It stores this data in a local MongoDB instance and displays the latest events through a simple web interface.

Features
Listens to GitHub webhook events (push, pull request, merge)
Stores events in a local MongoDB database
Shows timestamps in Indian Standard Time (IST)
Automatically updates the frontend every 15 seconds
Can be exposed to the internet using ngrok

How to Run Locally
Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/webhook-repo.git cd webhook-repo

Install required Python packages: pip install flask pymongo

Make sure MongoDB is running locally. The app connects to mongodb://localhost:27017/ by default.

Start the Flask server:python listening_to_webhook.py

In a new terminal window, start ngrok to expose your local server:ngrok http 5000

Copy the HTTPS URL generated by ngrok and set it as your action-repo GitHub webhook endpoint through settings. Be sure to add /webhook at the end of the URL.

Setting Up the Webhook in GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository(action-repo).
Navigate to Settings > Webhooks.
Click "Add webhook".
Paste your ngrok URL with /webhook (e.g., https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/webhook).
Set content type to application/json.
Select the events you want (e.g., push and pull requests).
